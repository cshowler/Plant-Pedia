<h1>FAQ: Questions & More!</h1>
<div class="FAQ-question">
    <button class="closed">
        How do I know when to water my plants?
    </button>
    <p style="display: none;">
        Depending on the plant, the leaves will react by either wilting, folding in on themselves, or falling off. The soil will also be dry to the touch (just be careful because sometimes soil will feel dry but is still hydrated under the surface!)
    </p>
</div>
<div class="FAQ-question">
    <button class="closed">
        What is "root-rot"?
    </button>
    <p style="display: none;">
        Root rot is when you soil is overly wet so it releases spores into the soil which turns the roots brown and squishy. If there are any healthy white roots left, you have to repot and replant with only the surviving white roots. 
    </p>

<div class="FAQ-question">
    <button class="closed">
        How do plants get mites?
    </button>
    <p style="display: none;">
        Spider mites are attracted to dry dusty plants. As well as plants that are overwatered. Certain pesticides can attract mites, so stick with water, oil, or specific mite pesticides.

<div class="FAQ-question">
    <button class="closed">
        How do I propogate my plants?
    </button>
<P style="display: none;">
    There are a few ways to propogate, or reproduce plants, from small pieces of the parent plant. You're going to want special propogating soil, which is different than multipurpose potting soil. Once you have a clipping of your stem you're going to plant it in the soil, not too deep, and cover it and keep it moist. If you have a leaf, do the same thing but leave it uncovered in indirect sunlight. Keep soil moist by spritzing it with water whenever the soil feels dry. It will take a few months to see root growth, but once you do you can cover them with some soil and watch your plant grow!

<div class="FAQ-question">
    <button class="closed">
        How do I know when to change pots?
    </button>
<p style="display: none;">
    You'll know you need to replant into a bigger pot when  <br> 1. the roots are growing through the bottom drainage holes.
    <br>
    2. The roots are pushing the plant up and out of its container.
    <br>
    3. The plant is top heavy and wants to fall over.
    <br>
    4. The soil dries out very quickly or has pulled away from the container sides and become hard.
    <br>
    5. The plant grows more slowly than usual.
</p>
</div>
<div class="FAQ-question">
    <button class="closed">
        Is my plant dying?
    </button>
<p style="display: none;">
There are few signs that your plant is dying, these include: wilting, brown or yellow leaves, slow growth, and more. If the plant is dehydrated the leaves will be brown and crispy, and if it has been over watered the leaves will be yellow and flacid.
